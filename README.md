# tobira-grammar
This is a repository to review and edit the Tobira grammar deck on Anki (https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/838871450) because there are a lot of mistakes in that specific deck.

The grammar points are ordered as in the book.
If you already reviewed grammar from a specific lesson, then new grammar cards will be reviewed after all cards.

To import the csv file, delete all not yet learned cards by selecting all the cards which have a Due number instead of a Due date.
After that, you can import the csv file and the learning order will be affected by the in-line added rows.
